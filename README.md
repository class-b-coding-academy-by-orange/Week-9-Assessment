### Week 9 Assessment 
* 1.Instructions:
  - Assessment time only one hour and a half.
  
## Question 1: To do list (80%)
* 1. build a simple application where we will store a to-do list.
 - You should use Express js.
 - You should use an array to store your tasks in the to-do list.
 - Your application should have the following routes:
   - `GET /tasks` - this should respond with a list of to-do tasks.
   - `POST /tasks` - this route should accept form data and add it to the to-do list.
   - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - this route should allow you to delete a specific task from the array

## Question 2:React (20%)

- 1. build a simple application where we will store a to-do list.

* Create TWO new components: `UserInput` and `UserOutput`
* UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
* Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
* Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
* Add state to the App component (`=> the username`) and pass the username to the `UserOutput` component
* Add a method to manipulate the state (`=> an event-handler method`)
* Pass the event-handler method reference to the `UserInput` component and bind it to the input-change event
* Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to `UserOutput`
* Add two-way-binding to your input (in `UserInput`) to also display the starting username
* Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets


## Question 3:Read a file (Bonus)

 - the result should appear using the console.
 
 Good Luck !! :)
